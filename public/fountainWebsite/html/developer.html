        <h1><u>~ About this project ~</u></h1>
        <p>I started this project with zero web development experience nor any knowledge of html/css. After watching some tutorials online, I figured I should try it out myself! For this project, I only used css and html to keep it simple. 
            I really enjoyed playing around with UI; I wanted to develope a night time, chic interface that granted the customer with a feel for 'The Fountain', 
            cocktail bar. When I stared the project, I was going to use some Bootstrap. However, I ended up not using any because I really wanted to understand how everything I created worked under 
            the hood.

        <h1><u>~ Obstacles I faced  &&  Overcoming those Obstacles ~</u></h1>
        <p>
            <li><u>FlexBox on the Menu Page::</u> This was 
                my first experience with flex box, so I had to learn exactly
                how it works. The main issues I had was content not aligning how I envisioned it,
                especially with different screen sizes. Before I tried flex box, I was using
                grid to format the layout. However grid was proving much more complicated than flex box,
                so I decided to simplify the Menu by breaking things down by row, utilizing flex box, versus 
                row/column formatting with grid. Now that I use grid often, I can see how it would serve the Menu page
                well, especially for a larger menu. </li>
                <br>
            <li><u>Picture Formatting::</u> The individual cocktail pictures were tricky as they were all different sizes. After lots of playing around in
                multiple applications, I decided to purchase Adobe PhotoShop and resize all the photos myself. Learning how to do 
                anything in PhotoShop proved to be an adventure all on it's own, ha! I also ended up using PhotoShop for the home
                background picture; I manipulated the opaqueness and created the reflection transition. The reflection was important
                as I wanted the Home page to have a smooth visual transition in case there was more vertical content.  
            </li>

    <p class="developer-note">* I do not own any of the images, nor is this Restaurant real... although I would go if it was, it looks nice! ha *</p>
