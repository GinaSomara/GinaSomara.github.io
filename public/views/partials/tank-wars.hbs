        <h3><u>~ About this project ~</u></h3>
        <p>The main goal of this project was to focus exclusively on the software design of a basic tank shooter video game. Coupling and Cohesion was analyzed when developing the overarching design. The largest challenge of the project was the designing the collision handling structure to navigate and correct entity interaction within the game world.

        <h3><u>~ Obstacles I faced && Overcoming those Obstacles  ~</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Collision Handling -</u>- The collision handling went through 3 different phases. The first phase was utilizing "instanceOf" within the game driver in order to properly handle collisions between all of the entities. After this was accomplished, I refactored this set up because using "instanceOf" inside the GameDriver was leading to higher coupling and lower cohesion. For the next phase, I created a Grid class to turn the game arena into a grid where all entities where assigned to their respective grid box. This significantly cut down on the time complexity: Previously the runtime was O(n^2) due to iterating through a nested loop in order to identify collisions. However with the grid, it diminished the time complexity to O(1) because the grid has a predefined and constant amount. With this implementation, only grid boxes that contained 2 entities were analyzed for collision handling. To complete the second phase, I then created an entire collision handling hierarchy in order to remove the responsibility from Game Driver, into a system designed specific for collision handling; this additionally and significantly cleaned up the GameDriver class.For the last phase in refactoring, I then utilized Generics and Java reflection [Class<? extends CollisionHandling>] in order cut down on the code duplication and complexities - significantly increasing memory efficiency - within the collision handling subclasses (i.e, TankTankCollisions, TankShellCollisions, TankWallCollisions, etc).</li>
            
            <br>

            <li><u>Entity Hierarchy -</u>- The entity hierarchy was originally developed with some entities dependent upon others: i.e, the Shell class (bullets) was located inside the Tank Class, because Shells cannot exist without Tanks. However in terms of collision handling, that proved to be complex. Therefore all entities within the game were then refactored to be equal - Shells, Tanks, Walls, Hearts etc. - Entities were inheriting from an Entity Abstract Class. However after completing the project this all entities treated equally, I noticed there was memory inefficiency due to not all classes needing to utilize all inherited abstract methods. Therefore, I re-conceptualized all of the subEntity classes based on how/what entities required in order to boost memory inefficiency.</li>
