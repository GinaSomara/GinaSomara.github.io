        <h1><u>~ About this project ~</u></h1>
        <p>I started this project with zero web development experience. After watching some tutorials online, I figured I should try it out myself! For this project, I only used css and html as I was learning everything for the first time. I really enjoyed playing around with UI; I wanted to develope a night time, chic interface that granted the customer with a feel for the Cocktail bar. I also enjoyed learning how all the elements of html and css worked. When I stared the project, I was going to use some Bootstrap as it was recommended in the tutorials. However, I ended up not using any Bootstrap. I really wanted to understand how everything I created worked under the hood.
